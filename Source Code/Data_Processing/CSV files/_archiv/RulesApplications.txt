Rules for Application.csv - file

Rows: all rows except row 1 are considered. Empty rows are ignored.

Column1: Number of Kostengruppe
Column2: Keywords connected to Kostengruppe in column1; Remark: no spaces between words (only if intentional),
	words need to be unique (e.g. if one of the words is "Dach", it will also be counted if the compared text contains "Dachfolie" etc)
	If two words shall be contained that are not necessarily consecutive, the structure is as follows: word1.*word2 (the order of the words matters!)
	No case sensitivity needed (i.e. "dach" is the same as "Dach")
Column3: Related Kostengruppen to the one in column1. This means that every entry with value in column1 has also values from column3
	Write words without spaces
